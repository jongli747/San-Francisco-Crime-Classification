# San-Francisco-Crime-Classification
#This is a machine learning/ data science competition from Kaggle. It requires several data preprocessing technique to fed the data into classifier. I use Knn and random forest algorithm. They evaluate the result with logloss function. I get 25% error, though there is still a room to decrease the error with powerfull classification algorithm like xgboost or lightgbm
