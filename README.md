# San-Francisco-Crime-Classification

This is a machine learning/ data science competition from Kaggle. It requires several data preprocessing technique to feed the data into the classifier. I use Knn and random forest algorithm. They evaluate the result with log loss function. I get 25% error, though there is still a room to decrease the error with powerful classification algorithms like xgboost or lightgbm
